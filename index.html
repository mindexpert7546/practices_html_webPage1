  <b>
      To work with an organisation where can learn new skills and increase my abilities for the organisational goal as well as my self.

I help students with whatever knowledge I have. I am very good coder in myself and I get such motivation when my coding test cases are passed. I have basic knowledge of C/C++, Python, but I know Java very well,. Because, I am very interested in Android app development.

I am very confident in my self because I learn many things by myself by exploring on the internet like : - Linux command, git and Github, contribution, basic knowledge of info sec, basic knowledge of Ethical hacking and how to improve my self.

When I am not working I usually spend my time singing and writing song, poem, poetry Etc.
